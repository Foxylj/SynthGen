# SynthGen: Audio Synthesizer Track Generation

## Overview
SynthGen is a project focused on the generation and modification of synthesizer tracks from mixed music using machine learning models. This project explores two main approaches: an LSTM-based model for generating synthesizer tracks from Mel Spectrograms and an Encoder/Decoder model that processes raw audio data for track modification.

## Models
- **LSTM Model**: Utilizes Mel Spectrograms to generate synthesizer tracks, capturing the temporal dynamics of audio.
- **Encoder/Decoder Model**: A convolutional neural network approach that works directly with raw audio data, aiming to isolate and enhance synthesizer components from mixed tracks.
