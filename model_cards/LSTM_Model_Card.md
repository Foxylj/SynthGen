# SynthGen LSTM Model Card

## Model Details
- **Model Name**: SynthGen LSTM v1.0
- **Developer**: Haosong Liu
- **Release Date**: TBD
- **Model Type**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- **Model Description**: 
  - This LSTM-based model is designed for generating synthesizer tracks from mixed audio. It utilizes a sequence of LSTM layers to process audio data represented as Mel Spectrograms.

## Intended Use
- **Primary Use**: Generation of synthesizer tracks from mixed music tracks.
- **Intended Users**: Music producers, researchers, and hobbyists interested in automated music production.
- **Out-of-Scope Use Cases**: 
  - The model is not designed for speech synthesis, non-musical audio processing, or real-time audio generation.

## Training Data
- **Dataset Description**: 
  - The model was trained on the Musdb dataset, which contains a variety of music tracks. The dataset was split into mixed tracks and corresponding isolated synthesizer tracks.
- **Preprocessing Steps**: 
  - Audio tracks were converted into Mel Spectrograms, normalized, and segmented for training.

## Evaluation Data
- **Dataset Description**: 
  - A subset of the Musdb dataset, separate from the training set, was used for evaluation.
- **Preprocessing Steps**: 
  - Similar preprocessing as training data was applied.

## Performance Measures
- **Evaluation Metrics**: 
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE) was used as the primary metric for performance evaluation.
- **Performance Results**: 
  - The model showed high MSE values, indicating challenges in accurately generating synthesizer tracks.

## Ethical Considerations
- **Potential Biases**: 
  - No explicit biases identified in the dataset, but the diversity of music genres may affect model generalization.
- **Impact on Stakeholders**: 
  - Aimed at assisting music producers, but care should be taken to not misrepresent the model's capabilities.

## Limitations and Biases
- **Known Limitations**: 
  - The model did not converge effectively, resulting in high MSE loss values. This suggests difficulties in the modelâ€™s ability to learn the underlying patterns for synthesizer track generation.
- **Biases**: 
  - Given the dataset's composition, the model's performance might be genre-specific and may not generalize well across different styles of music.

## Maintenance
- **Model Updates**: 
  - Future updates will focus on improving convergence and reducing MSE loss. Alternatives to MSE as a loss function may be explored.

## Caveats and Recommendations
- **Best Practices**: 
  - Users are advised to experiment with different preprocessing techniques and consider model fine-tuning for specific types of music tracks.
- **Usage Recommendations**: 
  - Best used as a baseline for research in music generation. Not recommended for commercial music production in its current state.
